# Example: `/product/features.md`

For a fictional Todoist-style task manager called Tasko. Note the shape: areas as `##`, features as `###`, a required `**ID:**` line, short descriptions in user language, and implementation references only where they help an agent get started.

# Feature Map

Tasko is a personal and team task manager: capture tasks fast, plan the day, share projects.

## Tasks

### Add a task
**ID:** `add-task`
**Description:** Add a task from anywhere with quick add. Dates, recurrence, project, labels and priority typed in plain language ("Pay rent every 1st #Finance p2") are recognized and shown as chips.
**Entry:** The + button, the `q` shortcut, or the empty "Add task" row inside any project.
**Flows:** [Add a task](flows/add-task.md)
**Implementation:** `src/features/quick-add/`, `src/lib/parse-task-text.ts`

### Organize tasks in projects and sections
**ID:** `projects`
**Description:** Group tasks into projects and sections, nest sub-tasks, reorder by drag and drop, and archive finished projects. New tasks land in Inbox unless a project is chosen.
**Entry:** Sidebar → Projects, or `#project` in quick add.
**Flows:** [Add a task](flows/add-task.md), [Share a project](flows/share-project.md)

### Schedule and reschedule
**ID:** `scheduling`

What makes this good
- Ten features, three areas, scannable in under a minute.
- Every feature is something a user would miss if it vanished.
- Conditions users notice (Inbox default, 3 free filters, Pro-only reminders, 5 collaborators) are here because they shape behavior; nothing about sync engines, queues or components.
- Implementation references appear only where an agent would otherwise have to search.
