# Example: `/product/flows/add-task.md`

Same fictional task manager as the Feature Map example. Note: the diagram is readable in seconds, behavior details exist only where a node needs them, implementation references are last and skippable.

# Add a task

## Goal

Capture a task in a few seconds from anywhere in the app, with its date, project, labels and priority understood from plain text, so it shows up in the right place without extra clicks.

## Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Open quick add] --> B[Type task text]
    B --> C[Recognize dates, project, labels, priority]
    C --> D{Anything recognized?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Show as removable chips]
    D -->|No| F[Keep as plain text]
    E --> G[Save]
    F --> G
    G --> H{Online?}
    H -->|Yes| I[Task saved]
    H -->|No| J[Saved locally, sync queued]
    I --> K([Task appears in its project and Today or Upcoming])
    J --> K
```

## Behavior details

#### Recognize dates, project, labels, priority

Runs as the user types. Examples: "tomorrow 9am", "every monday", "#Work", "@email", "p1".

**Result**
- Recognized parts are highlighted inline and shown as chips below the field
- Removing a chip keeps the words as plain text and stops re-recognizing them for this task

**Possible outcomes**
- ⚠️ Behavior unclear from the current implementation. Whether recognition follows the account language or the device locale when they differ is not covered by the UI or tests.

#### Save

**Requires**
- Task text is not empty after chips are removed

**Result**
- Project defaults to Inbox when none was chosen
- Due date is left empty when none was recognized
- Quick add closes, or stays open with an empty field when "Add another" was toggled

#### Online?

**Possible outcomes**
- Online: task is saved and visible on other devices within a few seconds
- Offline: task is kept locally with an "offline" badge and synced when the connection returns; if the server rejects it on sync, the task stays local and an error banner offers Retry

What makes this good
- Thirteen nodes, one main path, two branches a user can actually tell apart (recognized or not, online or not).
- Decisions are phrased as questions with labeled edges.
- Details only where the label is not enough; the honest `⚠️` marker instead of a guess.
- Links go both ways: to feature anchors and to neighbouring flows.
